                <p><em>Stubborness of Vision</em> is a video installation that explores ideas on environment perception and interpretation.</p>
                <p>The result is a composition that translates images from a camera in real time and imposes its own rules onto the output, the “Stubbornness of Vision”, on an ever-flowing abstract environment.</p>

                <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Research background</h3>
                <p>The openframeworks project comes from an idea to create a performance – installation based on H.G. Wells novel “The War of the Worlds”.</p>
                <p>Wells was originally inspired by the new scientific understandings of the day. Astronomical observations of Mars showed what it was understood as ice caps to be present and some scientists believed they observed an intricate network of channels criss–crossing the surface. These were interpreted as an advanced irrigation system constructed by intelligent beings. Newspapers were awash with ideas of little man from Mars.</p>
                <p>In retaliation to this absurd notion, Wells illustrated his Martians with science and evolution.</p>
                <p>The proposal is to create a vision system for the Martian tripods – the “war machines” – which the Martians that the Wells describes as “sluggard creatures” used on colonizing other worlds. In this interpretation the focus is on aspects of colonialism and dependency on technocracies to create a visualization that transpires the way our “world” is seen by an artificial / alien intelligence. The Martians trust these tripods to perceive and affect the world on their behalf, but how would a race with a different genealogy be able to correctly interpret the information that captures?</p>
                <p>The project plays with ideas of abstraction and misunderstanding of the human form.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The process started by exploring imaging techniques from different types of sensors as IR (from Kinect) and RGB. RGB sensors are more available and would facilitate anyone with a webcam to play with the code. The code will also function with an infra-red feed.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">

                </div>
                <p>Glitch experiments revealed quite interesting aspects of the process. With this it was possible to feel the machine behind the vision. The idea was not pursued much further as it proved to be hard to control the aesthetic results. In the above image it is possible to visualize the code that constitutes this alien vision.</p>

                </div>
                <p>First experiments on lighting and texturing. Initial iterations of the project included brightness / saturation and spectrum analysis, which are used in astronomy to observe chemical constituents of stars.</p>

                <p>Some more glitch: residual memory from the computers graphic card shines through the composition.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Some alternative aesthetics looked to “melt” the textures into the environment.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The composition offers the ability to be manipulated in real time, offering dramatic changes to its feel.</p>

                <p>The superimposition of the same feed in different overlays portrays an intelligence that is attempting to break from points of view, using instead a multicity of ideas and readings to observe its environment.</p>
                <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">

                <p>This is a screenshot from the final composition, the vision system tracks an human face (if any is found), the continuous presence of a human will lead the program to “malfunction” and present some glitch structures on its output.</p>

                <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted"> Presentation </h3>
                <p>This piece is to be presented in two distinct forms: a standalone installation featuring a Martian tripod and integrated into a theatrical piece as part of the visual design. The theatrical peace, which had a great deal of influence into the overall design focus on the moment of the invasion as depicted in the novel but tries to offer different overlooks “Who and Why?” refusing Cartesian good / evil shortcuts.</p>
                <p>The first tryouts involved creating a library of footage where the software was let to watch online gaming streams and another iteration where the output of the app was projected and analyzed again creating an environment where the human agency seems to have infinite repercussions.</p>
